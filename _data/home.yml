  title: "About Me"
  body: >
    I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Hanyang University, advised by Taeuk Kim, and a
    researcher at the Hanyang University NLP Lab.
    I study dialogue systems and large language models with a focus on building conversational agents
    that stay robust in realistic settings where user behavior is complex, underspecified, and changes
    over time.

  title: "Research Interests"
  body: >
    I focus on proactive conversational agents that reason beyond surface intent detection. My work
    models compound user intents, fluid shifts between task-oriented and open-domain dialogue, and latent
    preferences that emerge over long-term interaction. I explore how LLM-based agents can abstract
    persistent preference patterns, manage dialogue flow proactively, and ground inferred preferences into
    structured decisions such as tool calls.
